A Java EE 7 Project which uses the sakila database from Postgres Migrated to Mysql.
The Aim is to learn and document the Java EE implementation as I am learning it from java champion Adam Bien.

The Code is kep as neat as possible and done all in netbeans just to have a feel of the IDE.

The Repository is hosted at Openshift at http://javaee7app-archlinux.rhcloud.com/index.xhtml which should run a failrly recent version of the application.

There is also a REST Interface that shall be augmented as and when possible.
All the rest interfaces start with resources. e.g. http://javaee7app-archlinux.rhcloud.com/resources/actors

Further examples : http://javaee7app-archlinux.rhcloud.com/resources/actors/11 to get actor number 11.
